# The Biased Mind: Diversity and Inclusion in STEM

You can find a rendered version of this content [here](https://pawsey-internships.github.io/diversity_inclusion_workshop/)

This is a hands-on, 90 minute workshop in which we'll be thinking about the ways in which 
biases both good and bad effect all aspects of our science, from the people we work with to the data we analyse. We'll be working
through the pages on the left, so follow along as we walk through all the ways in which our science can (and should!) be diverse.
