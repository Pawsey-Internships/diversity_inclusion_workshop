Some things you could be thinking about are:\nNumber of attendees over time Abstracts submitted by attendees belonging to different demographics Home location of attendees Gender of attendees Career stage of attendees Do you notice any particular trends over time? Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that a picture tells a thousands words - so try to capture what you find in useful graphs. They don\u0026rsquo;t have to be complex to be effective!\n"

The more diversity you see around you the more your horizons expand in your work and your understanding Being open to new tools and types of working allows us to identify workplace biases and begin to correct for unhelpful ones.

Only participate in as much as you are comfortable with. Calling out is encouraged but don\u0026rsquo;t feel like you have to speak in front of everyone The live workshop will be recorded for those who cannot make it Over the next 90 minutes we\u0026rsquo;ll be thinking about the ways in which biases both good and bad effect all aspects of our science, from the people we work with to the data we analyse. We\u0026rsquo;ll be working through the pages on the left, so follow along as we walk through all the ways in which our science can (and should!) be diverse.\n"
