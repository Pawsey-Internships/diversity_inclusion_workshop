(write a nicer and slightly longer introduction at some point!)\nThings to note:\nThe workshop will be interactive; we\u0026rsquo;ll be discussing, voting and even doing a little bit of coding! Only participate in as much as you are comfortable with. Calling out is encouraged but don\u0026rsquo;t feel like you have to speak in front of everyone The live workshop will be recorded for those who cannot make it Over the next 90 minutes we\u0026rsquo;ll be thinking about the ways in which biases both good and bad effect all aspects of our science, from the people we work with to the data we analyse. We\u0026rsquo;ll be working through the pages on the left, so follow along as we walk through all the ways in which our science can (and should!) be diverse.\n"
