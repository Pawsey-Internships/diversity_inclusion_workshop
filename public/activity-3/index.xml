      <description>Working with biases We&amp;rsquo;ve prepared some conference data for you to explore. It contains anonymised details of attendees from 6 consecutive annual conferences for a large, American scientific body.
It is available on this public repo, and we&amp;rsquo;ve got some Colab notebooks setup for you here, here and here where you can begin to explore different aspects of conference attendance.
Working in groups, we want you to use some of the discussions we&amp;rsquo;ve had so far to guide your analysis of this dataset.</description>
