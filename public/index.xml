      <description>Standing up, standing out Spend 10 minutes discussing the following questions in your groups:
What do we have in common? How do we stand out from each other? Is standing out helpful or unhelpful? Are there any qualities that could be both helpful and unhelpful depending on the context? Nominate a scribe from your group to head to Mentimeter (use the code: 8793 5437) and add points from your discussion to each slide.</description>

      <description>What do we mean? Bias is a prejudice towards or against a specific group.
Diversity can refer to the mix of people in an organisation, or datapoints in your sample.
Inclusion is the outcome of behaviours promiting an environment where diverse people (or data points) can thrive. In an organisation, maximising inclusion also improves overall performance and wellbeing. Insert source?</description>

      <description>Our work and workplace In the workplace, inclusion means:
Equitable access to the resources, training, support, and recognition needed to excel. Feeling welcome, respected and valued. Acknowledging differences and how they can contribute to positive outcomes. Diversity and inclusion is consistent with Australia’s identity as a multicultural and egalitarian society.
The day-to-day work of science, engineering and other ‘technical’ fields can feel removed from social issues, but our work is highly collaborative and driven by its potential for a positive impact on the world at large.</description>

      <description>Workshop Overview Include a summary here once we have a clear idea of workshop structure.
Also include key takeaways.
The last version of the slides had these:
We learn and interact with each-other using tools that are unavoidably biased. Overlooked biases can harm individuals and undermine our goals. We can avoid unhelpful bias through diversity and inclusion. </description>
