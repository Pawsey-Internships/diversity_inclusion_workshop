## Standing up, standing out

Let's take 10 minutes to discuss:

1. What do we have in common?
2. How do we stand out from each other?
3. Is standing out helpful or unhelpful?
4. Are there any qualities that could be both helpful and unhelpful depending
on the context?

Nominate a scribe from your group to head to [Mentimeter](https://www.menti.com/al2y9teufpxn) (use the code: **8793 5437**) and 
add points from your discussion to each slide.
