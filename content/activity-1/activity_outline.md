### Standing Up, Standing Out

**Update Mentimeter Poll**

With your table, let's take 10 minutes to explore:

1. Qualities that you all have in common.
2. Qualities that stand you apart.
3. When these qualities have been helpful and unhelpful.

Nominate a scribe from your group to head to [Mentimeter](https://www.menti.com/al2y9teufpxn) (use the code: **8793 5437**) and add points from your discussion to each slide.
