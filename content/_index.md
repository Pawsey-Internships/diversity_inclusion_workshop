# The Biased Mind: Diversity and Inclusion in STEM

Welcome to the latest event in our internship workshop series! Over the next 90 minutes we'll be thinking about the ways in which 
biases both good and bad effect all aspects of our science, from the people we work with to the data we analyse. We'll be working
 through the pages on the left, so follow along as we walk through all the ways in which our science can (and should!) be diverse.

Things to note:
* The workshop will be interactive; we'll be discussing, voting and even doing a little bit of coding!
* Only participate in as much as you are comfortable with. Calling out is encouraged but don't feel like you have to speak in front of everyone
* The live workshop will be recorded for those who cannot make it
