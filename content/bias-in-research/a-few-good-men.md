## A Few Good Men

* Amazon's machine learning specialists uncovered a big problem; their new recruiting engine did not like women.
* They wanted the tool to identify the top 5 applicants from a pool of 100 resumes.
* A manual review of its suggestions found that the model had developed a preference for male applicants.
* Attemptments to correct this by obscuring the gender of applicants were unsuccessful. 
* The system penalised resumes that included the word 'woman', even in obviously positive phrases like "woman's chess club captain".
* It favoured applicants who used verbs more commonly used by male engineers, such as "executed" and "captured".
* The solution? Discarding the automated system entirely.
