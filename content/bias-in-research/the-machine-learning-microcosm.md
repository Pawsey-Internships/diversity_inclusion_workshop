## The Machine Learning Microcosm

* The impact of helpful and unhelpful bias is perhaps most obvious in Machine learning. To arrive at a model we:
	1. Start with an (ideally) unbiased system. 
	2. Bias, the system, according to an input representative training data, sets and carefully chosen training incentives.
	3. Test the model's prediction against a representative validation data set.
	4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the model can produce accurate and informative predictions.

* The choice of model, data and training incentives relies on human-made decisions.
* Whether historical, experimental or simulated, training and validation data is influenced by the decisions of an often unknowable number of strangers.
