### Case Studies
# Bias in Research

* Colloquially, bias understood as an unreasonable preference or dislike based on personal opinion.
* However, bias can also be dispassionate - not influenced by strong emotion, and instead arising through rational and impartial thought.
* As researchers, we rely on bias to:
	- Narrow on the scope of a project.
	- Communicate our results.
	- Identify patterns and relationships in data.
	- Build and test models of the world.
