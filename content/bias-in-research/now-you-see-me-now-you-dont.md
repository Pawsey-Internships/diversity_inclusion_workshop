* A major U.S. technology company developed a facial-recognition system with a claimed accuracy of 97%.
* However, in practice, the error rate was 0.8 % for light-skinned males and 34.7 % for dark-skinned females.
* This was attributed to a bias in the validation data set, which was more than 77% male and 83% light-skinned.
