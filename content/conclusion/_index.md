## Wrapping Up

* Diversity and inclusion as a solution was developed based on resolving societal gaps.
* It aims to pre-emptively mitigate future cases of discrimination and harmful bias.
* With hindsight on our side, we've identified and explored the impact of bias in this workshop.
* However, the story is less straightforward than "in the wild".
* People who perceive that it is more cost-effective to ignore issues related to diversity and inclusion than solve them implement the Ostrich Algorithm - sticking one's head in the sand and pretending there is no problem.

* It's up to all of us to encourage and promote diversity and inclusion as an opportunity for positive, challenging and meaningful engagement.
* Ensuring virtual workplace diversity and inclusion is a group effort.
