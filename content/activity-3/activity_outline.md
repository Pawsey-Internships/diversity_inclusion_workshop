## Working With Biases

We've prepared some conference data for you to explore. It contains anonymised details of attendees
from 6 consecutive annual conferences for a large, American scientific body.

It is available in [this public repo](https://github.com/Pawsey-Internships/biases-workshop-data),
and we've got some Colab notebooks setup for you [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zCJGvP8XzbXb9BMf9SMmC2TqEeBSEqRF?usp=share_link),
[here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qoD1bmT_Qm7-kOV55rzcp56ylJzH83C-?usp=share_link) and 
[here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/167KxbFwyb5GGaAsWn5OJsgUfanT9wGfs?usp=share_link) where you can
begin to explore different aspects of conference attendance.

Working in groups, we want you to use some of the discussions we've had so far to guide your analysis
of this dataset. Some things you could be thinking about are:
* Number of attendees over time
* Abstracts submitted by attendees belonging to different demographics
* Home location of attendees
* Gender of attendees
* Career stage of attendees
* *Do you notice any particular trends over time?*

Don't forget that a picture tells a thousands words - so try to capture what you find in useful
graphs. They don't have to be complex to be effective!
