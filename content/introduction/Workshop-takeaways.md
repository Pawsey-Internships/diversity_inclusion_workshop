### Workshop Overview

1. All human interactions and observations are unavoidably biased - including how we work in science.
2. Biases can be helpful or unhelpful, but we cannot make that judgement
without first identifying and understanding them.
3. The more diversity you see around you the more your horizons expand in your work and your understanding
4. Being open to new tools and types of working allows us to identify workplace biases and begin to correct for unhelpful ones.
