## What do we mean?

**Bias** is a prejudice towards or against a specific group.

**Diversity** can refer to the mix of people in an organisation, or datapoints in your sample.

**Inclusion** is the outcome of behaviours promiting an environment where diverse people (or
data points) can thrive. In an organisation, maximising inclusion also improves overall 
*performance* and *wellbeing*. (Shore et al. 2011)
