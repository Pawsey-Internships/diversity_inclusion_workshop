### Our work and workplace


In the workplace, inclusion means:
* Equitable access to the resources, training, support, and recognition needed to excel.
* Feeling welcome, respected and valued.
* Acknowledging differences and how they can contribute to positive outcomes.

Diversity and inclusion is consistent with Australia’s identity as a multicultural and egalitarian society.

The day-to-day work of science, engineering and other ‘technical’ fields can feel removed from social issues, 
but our work is highly collaborative and driven by its potential for a positive impact on the world at large.
