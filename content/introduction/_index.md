# Setting the scene

As we move through the workshop today, we ask that everyone:
* Be ready to participate.
* Use welcoming and inclusive language.
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism.

If you feel like you need support at any time during the workshop, 
messasge one of the mentors.
